include the character proposal form.

Description

Character Properties
--------------------

The preferred name of the characters are ‚Äú[\_\_\_\_\_\_]‚Äù. They should be added
to the [\_\_\_\_\_\_] block near other [\_\_\_\_\_\_] emoji. Properties of the
body-part emojis should be identical to those of other emoji.

-   General Category: Other Symbol (So)

-   Canonical Combining Class: 0

-   Bidirectional Class: Other Neutral (ON)

-   Bidi Mirrored: No

No case-mapping is required. The characters do not decompose in any way. They
are not whitespace nor control characters. They have no numeric value. They do
make use of emoji modifiers! They have emoji presentation by default. In
collation order they should be sorted near other body part emojis. They should
definitely be part of the [\_\_\_\_\_\_] category.

Factors for Inclusion
---------------------

### A. Compatibility:

There are no known legacy character sets containing [\_\_\_\_\_\_].

There are some emoji-like image sets, including stickers in messaging apps, that
include

### B. Expected Usage Level:

I have included several charts supplied by Google Trends showing the frequency
of searches for ‚Äú[\_\_\_\_\_\_]‚Äù in comparison to other emoji.

Google search for the term ‚Äú[\_\_\_\_\_\_]‚Äù returns [\_\_\_\_\_\_] results,
which is more than for [\_\_\_\_\_\_].

### C. Image distinctiveness:

...

### D. Completeness:

...

### E. Frequently Requested:

ASCII emoticons

Phallic symbols Flirtmoji, stickers

Factors for Exclusion
---------------------

### F. Overly Specific:

...

### G. Open-ended:

...

### H. Already Representable:

People currently are using a variety of metaphors especially for genitalia

### I. Logos, Brands etc.

...

### J. Transient:
