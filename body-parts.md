Introduction
------------

I hereby request the addition of eight external body part emojis to the Unicode Standard to complete the existing set of extremities.
These are a **foot**, a **leg**, a **buttocks**, a generic **genital area**, a **belly**, a **breast**, a **tooth** and a (femur) **bone**. 
Rationals, glyph examples, character properties as well as discussion of inclusion and exclusion factors are included on the following pages. As per [emoji submission guidelines](http://www.unicode.org/emoji/selection.html\#submission) this document does not include the character proposal form.

Since breasts and genitals differ significantly between male and female human bodies, but their depiction is also tabooesque in many contemporary cultures, I am also proposing to document ZWJ sequences using the Female Sign U+2640 and the Male Sign U+2642 as determiners (i.e. second part), which has many precedents for fuller-body emojis (e.g. professions).

Names
--------------------

The preferred [English CLDR data](http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/annotations/germanic.html) of the proposed characters are as follows; existing body parts shown for comparison:

Character Properties
--------------------

The preferred name of the characters are ‚Äú[\_\_\_\_\_\_]‚Äù. They should be added
to the [\_\_\_\_\_\_] block near other [\_\_\_\_\_\_] emoji. Properties of the
body-part emojis should be identical to those of other emoji.

-   General Category: Other Symbol (So)

-   Canonical Combining Class: 0

-   Bidirectional Class: Other Neutral (ON)

-   Bidi Mirrored: No

No case-mapping is required. The characters do not decompose in any way. They
are not whitespace nor control characters. They have no numeric value. They do
make use of emoji modifiers! They have emoji presentation by default. In
collation order they should be sorted near other body part emojis. They should
definitely be part of the [\_\_\_\_\_\_] category.

Factors for Inclusion
---------------------

### A. Compatibility:

There are no known legacy character sets containing [\_\_\_\_\_\_].

There are some emoji-like image sets, including stickers in messaging apps, that
include

### B. Expected Usage Level:

I have included several charts supplied by Google Trends showing the frequency
of searches for ‚Äú[\_\_\_\_\_\_]‚Äù in comparison to other emoji.

Google search for the term ‚Äú[\_\_\_\_\_\_]‚Äù returns [\_\_\_\_\_\_] results,
which is more than for [\_\_\_\_\_\_].

### C. Image distinctiveness:

...

### D. Completeness:

...

### E. Frequently Requested:

ASCII emoticons

Factors for Exclusion
---------------------

### F. Overly Specific:

...

### G. Open-ended:

...

### H. Already Representable:

People currently are using a variety of metaphors especially for genitalia

### I. Logos, Brands etc.

### J. Transient:
