Proposal for New Emojis: Five Colored Hearts
============================================

Introduction
------------

I hereby request the addition of **White Heart**, **Gray Heart**, **Pink Heart**, **Brown Heart**, **Teal Heart** and **Violet Heart** emojis to a future version of the Unicode Standard. 
Rationals, glyph examples, character properties as well as discussion of inclusion and exclusion factors are included on the following pages.
As per emoji submission guidelines (http://www.unicode.org/emoji/selection.html#submission), this document does not include the character proposal form.

Names
-----

It should not be necessary for the CLDR names to deviate from the UCD names. The gray heart emoji would probably need to use British spelling at least in the UCD, i.e. _Gr**a**y Heart_ (but I will use _a_ in this document).

| UCD/CLDR name	| CLDR keywords (English)	|
|--------------	|------------------------	|
| White Heart	| *snow, cold, wedding, argent*	|
| Grey Heart	| *gray, stone, iron, metal, cendrée*	|
| Pink Heart	| *fuchsia, magenta, love, cute, kawaii, IR, infrared, sanguine*	|
| Brown Heart	| *chocolate, poop, brunâtre, tenné*	|
| Teal Heart	| *turquoise, aqua, blue, céleste, ciel, sky, ice, cold*	|
| Violet Heart	| *purple, lilac, UV, ultraviolet, murrey*	|

Images
------

The glyphs are the same as for the existing Red Heart, Orange Heart, Yellow Heart, Green Heart, Blue Heart, Purple Heart and Black Heart emojis, just with different fill color or (monochrome) hatching pattern.

| Emoji style	| Text style	|
|------------	|-----------	|
| ![solid white fill](white-heart.png)	| ![no hatching](argent-heart.png)	|
| ![solid gray fill](gray-heart.png)	| ![pattern of alternating horizontal and vertical dashes](cendree-heart.png)	|
| ![solid pink fill](pink-heart.png)	| ![crosshatch of horizontal lines and diagonal from top left to bottom right](sanguine-heart.png)	|
| ![solid brown fill](brown-heart.png)	| ![crosshatch of vertical lines and diagonal from top left to bottom right](brunatre-heart.png)	|
| ![solid teal fill](teal-heart.png)	| ![horizontal dash-dot pattern](celeste-heart.png)	|
| ![solid violet fill](violet-heart.png)	| ![diagonal crosshatch, i.e. diamond pattern](murrey-heart.png)	|

Character Properties
--------------------

The characters do not decompose in any way, unless combining color swatches would be introduced before their addition. 
They do not make use of emoji modifiers. 
No ZWJ sequences are proposed that included them.
They have emoji presentation by default. 
In collation order, they should be sorted near other heart emojis. The achromatic White and Gray Hearts should be grouped with U+1F5A4 Black Heart. The order of colored heart emojis should follow the electromagnetic spectrum: pink, red, brown, orange, yellow, green, teal, blue, purple, violet (ascending or descending).
They should definitely be part of the Symbols category.

Factors for Inclusion
---------------------

### A. Compatibility:

There are no known legacy character sets containing these additional heart emojis.

#### Colored Metals, Gemstones etc.

| &#x1F3A8; Tincture	| &#x2697;&#xFE0F; Metal	| &#x1F48E; Gemstone	| &#x1F310; Planet / Roman deity	| &#x1F4C6; Day	|
|-------	|-------	|-------	|-------	|-------	|
| &#xFFEF; Argent	| `Ag` Silver	| Pearl	| ☽&#xFE0F; Moon / Luna	| Monday	|
| &#x2764;&#xFE0F; Gules	| `Fe` Iron	| Ruby	| &#x2642;&#xFE0F; Mars	| Tuesday	|
| &#x1F499; Azure	| `Sn` Tin	| Sapphire	| ♃&#xFE0F; Jupiter	| Wednesday	|
| &#x1F49C; Purpure	| `Hg` Quicksilver	| Amethyst	| ☿&#xFE0F; Mercury	| Thursday	|
| &#x1F49A; Vert	| `Cu` Copper	| Emerald	| &#x2640;&#xFE0F; Venus	| Friday	|
| &#x1F5A4; Sable	| `Pb` Lead	| Diamond	| ♄&#xFE0F; Saturn	| Saturday	|
| &#x1F49B; Or	| `Au` Gold	| Topaz	| ☉&#xFE0F; Sun / Sol	| Sunday	|

The proposed White Heart completes a set of colored hearts that relates to (European/Mediterranean) vexillology, heraldry, mythology, astrology, alchemy and folk symbolism as shown in the table above.

Some descriptions of the history of the Pride or Rainbow Flag attribute the colors of the 8-stripe version by Gilbert Baker (1978) to certain concepts of life and society:

- (hot) pink:	sexuality
- red:	life
- orange:	healing (friendship)
- yellow:	sunlight (vitality and energy)
- green:	nature
- turquoise:	magic / art
- indigo / blue:	serenity / harmony
- violet:	spirit (gratitude)

In the quoted case, Pink Heart and Teal Heart would complete the set. (Either the existing Purple Heart or the proposed Violet Heart would be used for "violet" here and depending on that either the Purple Heart or the Blue Heart would represent "indigo".)

Many striped flags that do not qualify for codes based upon ISO 3166 can be represented sufficently by a sequence of colored hearts and possibly other emojis, cf. some examples:

- Pan-African flag:	red-black-green
- Kurdish flag:	red-sun/white-green
- Anarchy flag:	red-black
- Romani flag:	blue-wheel-green
- Asexuality flag:	black-gray-white-purple
- Gynephilia flag:	black-gray-white-violet/pink
- Androphilia flag:	black-gray-white-blue
- Pansexuality flag:	pink-yellow-blue
- Transgenderism flag:	teal-pink-white-pink-teal
- _Bear_ flag:	brown-orange-yellow-rosy/pink-white-gray-black
