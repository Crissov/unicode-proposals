ZWJ Sequences Proposed by Apple
-------------------------------

Apparently, Apple has proposed additional ZWJ profession sequences in the summer
of 2016. They actually match entries previously found in my Further Ideas below.

ZWJ Sequences Actually Approved by Unicode (Beta)
-------------------------------------------------

There have been some changes to the proposals regarding the emoji being used to
represent the profession.

-   http://www.unicode.org/emoji/charts-beta/emoji-zwj-sequences.html

These pages also show variants with different non-default skin tones and gender
selection for existing emojis showing people.

| Codepoint |                      |    | Profession     |
|-----------|----------------------|----|----------------|

| U+1F527   | Wrench               | 🔧 | Mechanic       |

| U+2696    | Scales               | ⚖ | Judge          |
| U+2708    | Airplane             | ✈️ | Pilot          |

The semantic relationship between character and profession differs greatly. 
There are tools, products, work places and vehicles, accessoires, traditional symbols. 
The choices seem *very* arbitrary and not at all systematic. 
There is no indication whatsoever that empirical research has been done to find out which emojis – if any – users actually combine already to represent professions or activities.
