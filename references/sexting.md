Codepoint | Comment | Emoji
-----------|------------|------------------------
U+1F346 | “**The Eggplant**: The eggplant is the king of all flirt-mojis for a very simple reason: it looks like a dick. If you want to see someone’s dick, you can send them this emoji and they’ll understand what you want. Given that men don’t need much prompting to send their junk to strangers, only send this emoji if you’re prepared for the dick pics to follow.” | 🍆
U+1F60D | “**Heart Eye Emoji Face**: Short, sweet, and to the point. Your eyes are hearts, and your hearts are for bae. It’s not subtle, but it’ll send the message to whomever you’re texting that their flirting is having the desired effect. Can be used interchangeably with the cat heart eye emoji, which means the exact same thing except also you like cats. However, if you are going to use the cat heart eye emoji, you must remain vigilant that you're not swapping out all applicable emojis for their cat-faced counterparts, or you risk looking like a crazy cat lady in training.” | 😍
U+1F608 | “**Smiling Devil Emoji**: What better way to let someone you just met at a bar know you’re down for a little trouble than the smiling devil emoji? The smiling devil is cute (like you) but also not to be trusted (also like you), leaving the person on the other end of your text wanting to know more. Why is the devil smiling? What kind of trouble does this little guy want to get into? Is it sex? I bet it’s sex…” | 😈
U+1F525 | “**Fire Emoji**: No better way to let someone know they’re hot than to send them a picture of literal flames. The fire emoji is versatile, subtle, and can be used to indicate you think the fuckboy you just met at the bar is muy caliente, or can be used for emphasis when you roast him after he inevitably wrongs you.” | 🔥
U+1F483 | “**The Red Woman**: She’s dancing. She’s independent. She’s wearing a red maxi dress. She’s the modern woman. She's everything the object of your affection wants in a woman. When sending a flirty text, make sure to include this woman as a symbol for yourself. You want to be associated with her in his mind. TBH, you want to be associated with her in life.” | 💃
U+1F4B8 | “**The Flying Money**: Use this money to convey to any potential hookups a very simple message: “I am not a gold digger. In fact, I have so much money my cash is sprouting wings and flying around and I don’t even care. So do you wanna hook up or…?” All that and more is conveyed with this emoji. Using it makes you look like Rihanna (idk if Rihanna actually uses this emoji but I bet she does).” | 💸
U+1F61C | “**The Winking Tongue Man**: Oh no. No thank you. Steer clear of this man. Just imagine, for a moment, someone making this face at you in real life. One eye open wide as possible, the other closed, full length of the tongue exposed. It’s not a good look. Not only should you not to respond to any flirty texts that contain this emoji, but anyone who uses it should be immediately blocked. You don’t need this kind of negative energy in your life.” | 😜
U+1F4A9 | “**The Poop**: I’m sorry, but the poop emoji is over. It was over once everyone and their mom started using it, and it was wayyyy over when my 6-year-old cousin got a pillow version of it for Christmas. All this emoji conveys is that you are unoriginal and stuck in a world that was like, seven IOS updates ago. You wouldn’t go back to using an iPhone 4, so don’t use this emoji. It’s dead. RIP.” | 💩
U+1F | “**Horrible Clown**: This emoji is new and terrible. Who tf wanted this clown emoji? We’re all out here begging for a selfie-taking emoji (how tf is there not a selfie-taking emoji??) and all we get is this nasty-ass clown. I’ve never seen anyone use this emoji, but if a potential mate ever sends this to you, call the police. That person is a psychopath.” | 🤡
U+1F479 | “**Monster Face**: Similar to the clown, this little guy has no place in the bedroom. Apart from the fact that his nose kind of looks like a penis. His ears also kind of look like penises….and all of his teeth....Yeah, okay, it’s gonna be a hard pass on this penis monster. No thank you.” | 👹
U+1F4C9 | “**Graph**: This is a graph. Unless this is graphing a rise in horniness since the two of you started sexting, there’s really no useful application for this emoji in a flirting context. Actually, there is not much use for this emoji in any context. You’re telling me we can get a graph of nothing but can’t get a middle finger? Come on.” | 📉
U+1F917 | “**Jazz Hands**: This may actually be a hugging emoji, but who TF knows. Honestly, the fact that we don't even know WTF it is should be your first clue to avoid this thing. Like, what's going on here? Why is this thing smiling so big its eyes are closed? Why are its hands outstretched—is it trying to hug you, do jazz hands, give you a high-ten...? Furthermore, why doesn't it have arms? I honestly cannot think of a single circumstance that would warrant the use of this emoji. Fuck a hug—this emoji says "I want to molest you." I'm seriously questioning Apple over the fact that someone deemed this creeper necessary and it took like, six updates and four online petitions to get a damn taco.” | 🤗
U+1F351 | “**[Honorable Mention] The Peach**: Much like the eggplant, the peach looks like a butt. A big juicy butt. If you want to send, or receive, pics of a big juicy butt, or to convey that you are currently in possession of a big juicy butt, this is the emoji for you. If you’re trying to suggest you and your boo leave the bar and go eat a peach, maybe just use a different emoji because this one looks like a big juicy butt.” | 🍑

Codepoint | Comment | Emoji
-----------|------------|------------------------
U+1F413	| “**Cock**: The crown jewel of the new emojis: There is an actual cock”	| 🐓
U+1F34C	| “**Banana**: Purists turn their noses up at the can-be-comical banana, preferring to stick with the classier eggplant — or for the truly rarified, the _aubergine_. But eff that noise. We have a banana now. There's no going back.”	| 🍌
U+1F32C	| “**Wind-Blowing Face**: Blow job. Or blow me. Basically just implication of oral sex in general.”	| 🌬
U+26C8	| “**Thunderclap with Rain**: With or without raindrops, the thunderclap-as-orgasm is undeniable. With rain for the men (or the ladies who are adept at [this skill](https://www.bustle.com/articles/59880-how-do-you-squirt-my-vagina-and-i-gave-female-ejaculation-a-try-and-it-had)).”	| ⛈
U+1F329	| “**Thunderclap without Rain**: Without rain: Just your garden variety orgasm. "Thanks for the sext sesh. Till next time. Signing off."”	| 🌩
U+1F327	| “**Raincloud**: A variation on the above, without any explosive/mind-bending quality. Nothing too shabby — just a good, old-fashioned, quiet orgasm.”	| 🌧
U+1F37E	| “**Champagne Bottle**: Just came.”	| 🍾
U+2604	| “**Comet**: Just came.”	| ☄️
U+1F3F9	| “**Bow + Arrow**: Just came.”	| 🏹
U+1F6E9	| “**Small Aircraft**: Just came.”	| 🛩
U+1F6EB	| “**Plane Taking Off**: Just came.”	| 🛫
U+1F6EC	| “**Plane Landing**: Just came. As in, you just brought it in for a landing. (So the planes work coming *and* going.)”	| 🛬
U+1F6F0	| “**Satellite**: Just came.”	| 🛰
U+1F32A	| “**Tornado**: "So turned on."”	| 🌪
U+1F6E5	| “**Motorboat**: ...motorboat.”	| 🛥
U+1F4FF	| “**Prayer Beads**: Sorry if this is sacrilegious, but there are *prayer beads*. Generally I steer clear of the religious emojis when looking to get my sext on, but these are too good to ignore. If you're in the mood for something a bit kinkier, throw these into the mix during your next "Tell me your fantasies" conversation (held via text, natch).”	| 📿
U+1F39E	| “**Filmstrip**: "Please send dick pic/tit pic/clit pic."	| 🎞
U+1F4FD	| “**Movie Projector**: Sex tape, or some iteration thereof.”	| 📽
U+1F5A5	| “**Desktop Computer**: Skype sex?”	| 🖥
U+1F3F8	| “**Badminton Racquet + Shuttlecock**: They actually gave us *two* cocks with the new emojis. Thanks, Unicode! You guys are keeping it *tight*. Could also double as some paddle action for an S&M-minded lass.”	| 🏸
U+1F3D3	| “**Table Tennis Paddle + Ball**: An alternate paddle, this one more literal.”	| 🏓
U+1F56F	| “**Candle**: Same realm: "Pour some hot wax on me."”	| 🕯
U+26D3	| “**Chains**: Damn.”	| ⛓
U+1F5DC	| “**Compression**: Things are getting *kinky*, Apple.”	| 🗜
U+1F32E	| “**Taco**: Well, the taco has been the source of much ado. About nothing, really, at least nothing to do with actual tacos. Everyone knows the taco is finally here just to give the ladies a fallback to the peach. Like the great banana/aubergine controversy of 2015, people will take sides. Let it be known: I'm on the side of the peach. But this is an OK standby, I suppose. It's just kind of gross.”	| 🌮
U+1F32F	| “**Burrito**: See taco. For some reason, some outlets are [equating this with a penis]("http://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicamisener/better-luck-sext-time#.qiMRO10xxB), but I just don't see it. If anything, this is yet another auxiliary to the peach. And I feel the same way about this as I do about the taco, for what it's worth.”	| 🌯
U+1F573	| “**Hole**: Another crass substitute for the peach.”	| 🕳
U+1F981	| “**Lion**: ...or, as I like to see it, p\*ssy. This one I can get down with.”	| 🦁
U+1F32D	| “**Hot Dog**: Now I'm just going to devolve into alternatives to the mighty aubergine/banana/cock. Bear with me.”	| 🌭
U+1F3D2	| “**Ice Hockey Stick**: Penis.”	| 🏒
U+1F3D1	| “**Field Hockey Stick**: Penis.”	| 🏑
U+1F3CF	| “**Cricket Bat **: Penis.”	| 🏏
U+1F336	| “**Chili Pepper **: Penis.”	| 🌶
U+1F579	| “**Joystick**: Penis.”	| 🕹
U+1F5E1	| “**Dagger**: Penis. (See also: daggering.)”	| 🗡
U+2694	| “**Crossed Swords**: Crossing swords. (Well, that one was easy.)”	| ⚔
U+2692	| “**Hammer + Pick**: Crossing swords.”	| ⚒
U+1F6E0	| “**Hammer + Wrench**: Crossing swords.”	| 🛠
U+2699	| “**Gear**: Cock ring.”	| ⚙
U+1F595	| “**Middle Finger**: "F-ck me." Or just another variation on the already fertile emoji hand signal options we already had.”	| 🖕
U+1F918	| “**Rock On Fingers**: More options.”	| 🤘
U+1F596	| “**Vulcan Salute Fingers**: And still more.”	| 🖖
U+1F590	| “**Open Hand**: One more.”	| 🖐
U+1F575	| “**Sleuth**: Perfect for signaling to your boo that you're down to try out some role-playing. "Wear your most Sherlock-y trench coat."”	| 🕵

U+1F6CB	| “**Couch **: Do me on the couch.”	| 🛋
U+1F6CC	| “**Person In Bed**: In bed waiting for you.”	| 🛌
U+1F321	| “**Thermometer**: It's getting hot in herre.”	| 🌡
U+1F39B	| “**Level Slider**: Kicking things up to the next level.”	| 🎛
U+1F980	| “**Crab **: For a sext of a more unfortunate variety.”	| 🦀
U+1F911	| “**Money Face**: Money shot. Also just a more turnt-up variation on the classic licking smiley face — though not half as cute.”	| 
U+1F917	| “**Hugging Face**: "I want to touch your breasts." Or: "Please touch my breasts."”	| 🤗
U+1F642	| “**Slightly Smiling Face**: To register light agreeability in relation to a sexy suggestion your partner makes, but not appear too enthusiastic. Into it — but not *that* into it.”	| 🙂

Codepoint | Comment | Emoji
-----------|------------|------------------------
U+1F984  | “**Unicorn**: For starters, the unicorn's horn is pretty penis-like. Aside from that, though, [the term "unicorn" is a colloquialism in the LGBT community](https://www.bustle.com/articles/114024-watch-straight-people-guess-the-meaning-of-gay-slang-terms-video): A bisexual woman who wants to be in your threesome — aka she doesn't exist. Looks like this emoji will be a staple in sexting from now on.” | 🦄
U+1F32D	| “**Hot Dog**: "Wiener" is one of the most popular (and childish) nicknames for a penis, and now we finally have the emoji to match! Looks like the eggplant has officially been ousted as the emoji of choice when referencing a penis via text. The hot dog reigns supreme!”	| 🌭
U+1F32E	| “**Taco**: Ugh, as much as I *hate* when people call a vagina a "taco" (so demeaning and gross), there's no doubt in my mind that this will quickly become a favorite [emoji equivalent for vagina](https://www.bustle.com/articles/114036-7-clever-ways-to-create-a-vagina-in-emoji). Just make sure the girl you're sexting knows her vagina is much sexier and more appealing than a Mexican cuisine item. Plus, there are plenty of [more eloquent, less offensive euphemisms](https://www.bustle.com/articles/105361-what-do-you-call-your-vagina-17-bustle-readers-weigh-in-on-their-favorite-names) that don't compare vaginas to a consumable piece of food.”	| 🌮
U+1F32C	| “**Wind-Blowing Face**: Blow job reference, anyone? Paired with any penis-shaped emoji, this new emoji will make your oral fixation crystal clear. Plus, she looks majestic and seductive AF, if you ask me.” | 🌬
U+1F6CF	| “**Bed**: What better way to insinuate that you're ready to digitally get hot and heavy than by sending a bed emoji accompanied by a smirk or wink? It quite literally sets the scene for any sexting that follows. Or if you're feeling impatient and horny and just want your partner to come over ASAP: Bed emoji + you + me, now!”	| 🛏
U+1F32F	| “**Burrito**: All the burrito enthusiasts out there know that burritos can be pretty phallic-looking. They're round, long, and boy, are they *thick*. This new emoji, aside from finally allowing you to let bae know when to bring you Chipotle, also gives you another emoji alternative to the eggplant-as-penis trick.”	| 🌯
U+1F336	| “**Hot Pepper **: For when things are getting hot, hot, hot! Since this particular food item is a little random, the pepper might be a good emoji to use playfully alongside something else, so maybe say, "oooh, that's hot!" or "spicing things up, eh?" and then tack the pepper on at the end for emphasis.”	| 🌶
U+1F917	| “**Hugging Face**: "After the sexting is done and you're in cuddle mode, this new hugging emoji is the perfect way to virtually snuggle up. It's not quite as satisfying as spooning IRL, but the little emoji face sure is adorable.”	| 🤗
U+1F595	| “**Middle Finger**: "Sometimes, someone tries to sext you and you're just like, *um no*. If someone is being creepy and trying to harass you via text, now there's finally a middle finger emoji to let him or her know to *back the hell off*. Or maybe you're totally cool with your sexting partner, but they make an off-color joke or say something that doesn't exactly turn you on. The middle finger can also be a playful way to say, "Thanks but no thanks."”	| 🖕
U+1F579	| “**Joystick**: If you consider yourself a nerd (which is not a bad thing, BTW), you'll be delighted to know you can now compare your man's junk to an old-school gaming controller: the joystick. It's knob-like and meant to be *handled*, if you know what I mean.”	| 🕹

U+1F  | “**Skull**: First and foremost, there should be *zero* allusions to death in any sexting convo. I would hope that this would never even come up in the first place, but after that weird AF [Scream Queens cemetery scene with Chad and Hester](http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a47340/scream-queens-episode-4-recap/), you never know. Plus [Halloween is approaching](https://www.bustle.com/articles/116448-make-perfect-emoji-pumpkins-for-halloween-in-3-super-simple-steps-diy), so I just wanted to be extra certain that no digital necromancy is going on. Moving on.”	| 
U+1F  | “**Poop**: Yes, it's adorable, but it's not exactly the emoji of choice for when you want to ooze sexuality, particularly when you're discussing anal. (Unless you're talking specifically about a brown shower fetish — aka you like to poop/be pooped on — in which case you should go for it.)”	| 
U+1F  | “**Corn**: Yeah, this particular emoji kind of looks like a penis. But if you choose emoji as your language of love, there are two much better, more phallic options: the always-arousing eggplant and the half-peeled banana. Something about corn just seems...wrong for this kind of interaction, IMHO.”	| 
U+1F  | “**Baby**: You might call your S.O. "baby" between the sheets, but this emoji is a bad omen if I've ever seen one. There's nothing remotely sexy about that bald little head — stick to typing out the word rather than resorting to this odd choice of emoji.”	| 
U+1F  | “**Apple**: Yes, "apple-bottomed" might be a semi-popular way to describe someone with a curvy ass, but if you're sexting and want to allude to a woman's (or man's) *ass*ets, you should stick with the Kim K-approved, certified-booty-like emoji: the juicy peach.”	| 
U+1F  | “**Hammer**: Ugh, is there anything worse than someone who uses verbs like "ramming," "pounding," or "hammering" to describe intercourse? If you like it rough, more power to you, but words like "hammer" — and its corresponding emoji — have no place in the sexting world. Search your sexual thesaurus for a more creative (but less childish) action verb, please.”	| 
U+1F  | “**Lollipop**: Despite what Lil Wayne might have you believe, a lollipop is not a sexy euphemism for "blow job." Personally, the connection between a candy popular amongst children and a *very* adult sexual act gives me the shivers. It might be funny to sext this emoji to see if your S.O. gets your obscure '00s rap reference, but if you actually want to turn anyone on, you're better off with the tongue + eggplant combo.”	|

Die Aubergine: Eindeutiger geht's ja wohl nicht! Die einzige Möglichkeit einen Penis in Emoji-Form aufs Smartphone zu zaubern.

Die drei Regentropfen: Nein, die drei Tropfen sollen keinen Regen darstellen. Jedenfalls nicht, wenn wir von Sexting reden. Im Sex-Code stehen sie für den Orgasmus oder so anstrengenden Sex, dass der Schweiß in Strömen geflossen ist.

Die ausgestreckte Zunge: Keine freche Geste, sondern die Umschreibung für Oralsex.

Der Hundekopf und das kniende Figürchen: Einer unserer Favoriten. Eigentlich handelt es sich dabei um zwei Emojis. Nämlich den süßen Hundekopf und das Figürchen, was auf allen vieren kniet. Nur logisch, dass es somit für die Sexstellung Doggystyle steht.

Die zwei eindeutigen Finger: Einfach nur Sex!

Der Pfirsich: Was die Aubergine für den Mann ist, ist der Pfirsich bei den Emojis für die Frau. Und die Ähnlichkeit zu einem knackigen Po ist doch auch wirklich eindeutig!
