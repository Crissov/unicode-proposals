Introduction
------------

I hereby request the addition of a [\_\_\_\_\_\_] emoji to the Unicode Standard.
Rationals, glyph examples, character properties as well as discussion of
inclusion and exclusion factors are included on the following pages. As per
emoji submission guidelines
(http://www.unicode.org/emoji/selection.html\#submission) this document does not
include the character proposal form.

Character Properties
--------------------

The preferred name of the character is “[\_\_\_\_\_\_]”. It should be added to
the [\_\_\_\_\_\_] block near other [\_\_\_\_\_\_] emoji. Properties of the
[\_\_\_\_\_\_] emoji should be identical to those of other emoji.

-   General Category: Other Symbol (So)

-   Canonical Combining Class: 0

-   Bidirectional Class: Other Neutral (ON)

-   Bidi Mirrored: No

No case-mapping is required. The character does not decompose in any way. It is
not whitespace nor a control character. It has no numeric value. It does [NOT\|]
make use of emoji modifiers. It has [TEXT\|EMOJI] presentation by default. In
collation order it should be sorted near other [\_\_\_\_\_\_] emoji. It should
definitely be part of the [\_\_\_\_\_\_] category.

Factors for Inclusion
---------------------

### A. Compatibility:

There are no known legacy character sets containing [\_\_\_\_\_\_].

### B. Expected Usage Level:

I have included several charts supplied by Google Trends showing the frequency
of searches for “[\_\_\_\_\_\_]” in comparison to other emoji.

Google search for the term “[\_\_\_\_\_\_]” returns [\_\_\_\_\_\_] results,
which is more than for [\_\_\_\_\_\_].

### C. Image distinctiveness:

...

### D. Completeness:

...

### E. Frequently Requested:

...

Factors for Exclusion
---------------------

### F. Overly Specific:

...

### G. Open-ended:

...

### H. Already Representable:

...

### I. Logos, Brands etc.

...

### J. Transient:
