### Vehicle Classes of the European Driving Permit 🇪🇺

The European Drivin Permit (EDP) is a proper superset of the IDP in that it adds some vehicle classes that apply to all member countries, A2, AM and B1.

| Class | Type | Emoji | Description | Trailer Class | Description |
|-------|------|-------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| AM | Moped             | 🛵 Motor Scooter     | ≤ 50 cm³ ∧ ≤ 45 km/h | — | — |
| A  | Heavy Motorcycle  | 🏍 Racing Motorcycle | > 50 cm³ ∨ > 45 km/h | — | — |
| A1 | Medium Motorcycle | — | ≤ 125 cm³ ∧ ≤ 11 kW | — | — |
| A2 | Light Motorcycle  | — | ≤ 35 kW ∧ ≤ 0.2 kW/kg | — | — |
| B  | Automobile / Car  | 🚗 Automobile        | ≤ 3.5 t | BE | > 0.75 t |
| B1 | Quad & Trike      | — | > 50 cm³, > 4 kW, ≤ 15 kW, ≤ 450 kg | — | — |
| C  | Lorry             | 🚛 Articulated Lorry | > 3.5 t | CE | > 0.75 t |
| C1 | Truck             | 🚚 Delivery Truck    | ≤ 7.5 t | C1E | > 0.75 t |
| D  | Bus               | 🚌 Bus               | > 1+8 💺 | DE | > 0.75 t |
| D1 | Minibus           | 🚐 Minibus           | ≤ 1+16 💺 | D1E | > 0.75 t |

Some member countries have added or retained even more national classes. 
Most of these do (usually) not partake in normal street traffic.

* *F/T/W* Tractor 🚜 
* *G* 🏗 Excavator, …
* *H/TRAM* Tram 🚋
* *L* Light tractor 🚜 (without trailers)
* *M* Moped 🛵, now covered by AM or A2
* *S* Snowmobile
* *TROL* Trolley bus 🚎

<!--
* Emergency vehicle 🚓🚑🚒
* RV 🚙
* Taxi 🚕

### Trailer combinations

* 🚗 – may be same height (≥ 750 kg, possibly 2 axes) 
           or flat (< 750 kg, 1 axis)
* 🚙 Caravan (+ 🐎/🐴, 🚤, ⛺️/🏕)
* 🚌 – may be larger than for Car, 1 or 2 axes
* 🚐 – may be larger than for Car, 1 axis
* 🚚 – matching style, 2 axes
* 🚛 – may already include a trailer (possibly carrying a container), because almost useless without, except when it can carry a container itself – + 🛢/⛽️, 🚗 …
* 🚜 Crops Car (2 axes)
* 🏍 Sidecar? / Tuktuk?
* 🚲 Baby Carrier or Transport Trailer (1 axis)
* 🐎 Carriage (2 axes) – transport
* 🏇 Sulky (1 axis) – sport
* 🐕 Wheeled Dog Sledge
    (could use U+1F6…… Sled for traditional winter version)
* 🐃🐂🐄 Carriage (1 axis)
* 🐪🐫 ?
* 🐘 ?
* 🚶 Wheelbarrow / Handcart
* 🏃 Rickshaw
* 🏠 (left side) Motor Home, Caravan

also possible, without special handling needed, but design considerations apply:

* 🚕 – identical to Car, maybe matching color
* 🚓 – identical to Car, maybe matching color
* 🚑 – identical to Car, maybe matching color
* 🚒 – identical to Car, maybe matching color
* 🚎 – similar to Bus or Minibus, overhead cable should extend
* 🏎 – quite unusual, but should match direction of other vehicles, Tractor Pull

possible alternatives for the above where design consideration don’t apply because of orientation / direction:

* 🚘
* 🚍
* 🚖
* 🚔
* 🐴

### Motorcycle

*Motorcycle* should also have a design note to discourage showing a rider. A person should only be visible in something like *Motorcycling*, i.e. an activity not a vehicle.❌

Character Properties
--------------------

The preferred names of the characters are “[______]”. 
They should be added to the Transport and Map Symbols block near other vehicle emoji. 
Properties of the vehicle emojis should be identical to those of other emoji.

-   General Category: Other Symbol (So)

-   Canonical Combining Class: 0

-   Bidirectional Class: Other Neutral (ON)

-   Bidi Mirrored: No

No case-mapping is required. 
The characters do not decompose in any way. 
They are not whitespace nor control characters. 
They have no numeric value. 
They do not make use of emoji modifiers. 
They all have has emoji presentation by default, but should be available as monochrome text-style as well. 
In collation order they should be sorted near other motor vehicle emojis. 
They should definitely be part of the vehicle category.

Factors for Inclusion
---------------------

### A. Compatibility

There are no known legacy character sets containing any of the proposed characters. 
Unicode has one code point assigned to a vehicle symbol that is not marked as an emoji (yet): ⛟ U+26DF Black Truck. It does not seem to differ clearly from Delivery Truck and Articulated Lorry.
Cars are also featured on some other symbol characters (traffic signs):

- ⛍ U+26CD Disabled Car
- ⛐ U+26D0 Car Sliding

### B. Expected Usage Level

Rather low. Although most people use at least one kind of vehicle every day, most vehicle emojis are among the lesser used, at least [on Twitter](http://emojitracker.com).

![Screenshot of emojitracker.com from 17 December 2016, with vehicle and related emojis highlighted]()

I have included several charts supplied by Google Trends showing the frequency of searches for “[______]” in comparison to other emoji.

Google search for the term “[______]” returns [______] results, which is more than for [______].

### C. Image distinctiveness

Yes … it’s good enough for street signs

### D. Completeness

Yes, the proposed emojis would cover all automobile classes currently distinguished in license and registration laws of most countries. 
This proposal does not cover cases of distinction “under the hood”, 
which are mostly relevant for taxation and insurance and not clearly visible from the outside.

### E. Frequently Requested

Not really.
There are lots of vehicle emojis already and new ones are requested much less than emoticons, hand signs, flags, animals or food. 
Completeness is the major argument to legitimate this proposal.

A *pickup truck* emoji is frequently requested from some areas, but is not included in this proposal because it usually does not require a separate driving permit.

Factors for Exclusion
---------------------

### F. Overly Specific

No. 
The selected decisive criterion for this proposal is legal distinction. 
If lawmakers around the globe see a need to require different licenses for different vehicle categories and even agree on many of them internationally, 
it seems very likely that users will frequently need the same kind of differentiation.

The *Trailer* emoji is intended to be generic and does not distinguish e.g. Horsebox and Caravan. 
This should be done with emoji sequences. 
Popular ones could later be standardized as ZWJ ligatures.

### G. Open-ended

Driving Permit classes *may* be extended in the future, 
but that’s not expected to result in more than a handful of characters in the predictable future, 
e.g. Self-Driving Car or Flying Car.
This proposal specifically does not request emojis for different types (or even brands) of cars that commonly require the same license, 
e.g. Electric Car, Sedan, Convertible, Minivan and Pickup Truck. 
If someone wanted to propose something like that, they would perhaps base it upon the coding standard used by car rental companies world-wide. 

This proposal explicitly does not deal with naval (e.g. Jetski), aerial (e.g. Hot-Air Balloon), rail-based (e.g. Mining Tub, Hyperloop) and non-motorized (e.g. Skateboard, Rollerskates, Stroller, Monocycle) vehicles, many of which have their own sets of (international) license requirements and existing emojis. 
It also does not cover special-purpose, professional vehicles, which usually require special training and are mostly operated outside regular traffic, 
e.g. Forklift, Excavator, Bulldozer, Harvesters and Garbage Truck,
as well as single-vendor product categories,
e.g. Segway.

### H. Already Representable

U+1F683 Railway Car 🚃 could be reused as a *Trailer*, but looks and feels strange in combination with street-bound vehicles (🛣 vs. 🛤). 
However, similar considerations apply as to the combination with other emojis, i.e. locomotives of all kinds:
🚂🚃 – the Railway Car works well enough with the Steam Locomotive – Tender?
🚋🚃, 🚞🚃 – it kinda works with the Tram Car and Mountain Railway, except for the cable and mountain, respectively
🚅🚃, 🚄🚃, 🚈🚃 – it doesn’t work well with any of the other left-facing trains, but should probably adapt its design accordingly
🚝🚃, 🚟🚃 – it’s worse with special types of rails
🚆🚃, 🚇🚃, 🚊🚃 – it doesn’t work at all with front-facing Train, Metro and Tram, but probably also doesn’t have to
🛲🚃 – Diesel Locomotive isn’t defined in Unicode as an emoji, but could be

U+1F6F5 Motor Scooter 🛵 (often displayed without a rider) and U+1F3DC Racing Motorcycle 🏍 (often displayed with a rider) could be reused as a generic motorized two-wheeled vehicle, 
but the usual glyphs are more appropriate to signify subcategories of generic *Motorcycles* or *Motorbikes*.

A *Snowmobile* could be represented as a sequence of a motorcycle and an emoji for winter, snow or skiing, 
e.g. U+2744 ❄️, U+2603 ☃️, U+26C4 ⛄️, U+1F328 🌨, U+1F3C2 🏂, U+1F3BF 🎿, U+26F7 ⛷, U+26F8 ⛸ or U+1F6…… Sled.

### I. Logos, Brands etc.

Does not apply. 
Glyph design should usually be agnostic of particular manufacturers, except in special-purpose typefaces,
e.g. promotional or for brand use.

### J. Transient

The need for a licensed human driver may vanish for some vehicles in the years to come due to advances in automation, 
but the overall categories will remain for at least a couple of decades.
