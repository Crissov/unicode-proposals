======================================================

Introduction
------------

I hereby request the addition of 19 ZWJ emoji sequences to the Unicode Standard. Rationals, glyph examples, character properties as well as discussion of inclusion and exclusion factors are included on the following pages.
As per emoji submission guidelines (http://www.unicode.org/emoji/selection.html#submission) this document does not include the character proposal form.

The semantic distinction between 📆 U+1F4C6 and 🗓 U+1F5D3 is hard to see in many deployed fonts and image collections. It ma be beneficial to designate them to specific lengths: day and week, respectively.


Glyph and Design
----------------

### Bases

- 📅 U+1F4C5 monthly (or annual?) calendar
- 📆 U+1F4C6 tear-off daily calendar
- 🗓 U+1F5D3 flip/spiral daily (or weekly?) calendar
