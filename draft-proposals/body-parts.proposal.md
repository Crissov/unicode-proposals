Character Properties
--------------------

The preferred name of the character is “[______]”. It should be added to the [______] block near other [______] emoji. Properties of the [______] emoji should be identical to those of other emoji.

* General Category: Other Symbol (So)

No case-mapping is required. The character does not decompose in any way. It is not whitespace nor a control character. It has no numeric value. It does [NOT|] make use of emoji modifiers. It has [TEXT|EMOJI] presentation by default. In collation order it should be sorted near other [______] emoji. It should definitely be part of the [______] category.
