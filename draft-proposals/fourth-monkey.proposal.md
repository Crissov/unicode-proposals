Introduction
------------

I hereby request the addition of a **Do-No-Evil Monkey** emoji to the Unicode Standard. Rationals, glyph examples, character properties as well as discussion of inclusion and exclusion factors are included on the following pages.
As per the [emoji submission guidelines](http://www.unicode.org/emoji/selection.html#submission) this document does not include the character proposal form.

Glyph and Design
----------------

The canonic Three Wise Monkeys are almost always depicted as covering their eyes (🙈 *See-No-Evil* U+1F648), ears (🙉 *Hear-No-Evil* U+1F649) and mouth (🙊 *Say-No-Evil* U+1F64A), respectively, hence can easily be limited to show the head. 
There is some considerable deviation and variation for the non-canonic fourth monkey. Its hands are often shown crossed or tied and either above its head or in its lap. The former depiction is better compatible with existing glyphs and can also symbolize the less frequent alternative *Think-No-Evil Monkey* while the latter hints – sometimes in a quite obvious way – at the sexual innuendo of ‘doing something evil’. Other specific activities are also sometimes depicted, e.g. *Write-No-Evil* or *Smell-No-Evil*.

Character Properties
--------------------

The preferred name of the character is “Do-No-Evil Monkey”. It should be added to the Supplemental Symbols and Pictographs block near other facial or animal emoji, e.g. as U+1F91F, in rows U+1F92x or U+1F93x or somewhere in rows U+1F99x–1F9Ax. Properties of the Do-No-Evil Monkey emoji should be identical to those of other emoji.

* General Category: Other Symbol (So)
* Canonical Combining Class: 0
* Bidirectional Class: Other Neutral (ON)
* Bidi Mirrored: No

No case-mapping is required. The character does not decompose in any way, since U+1F648–A are also not considered compositions of either U+1F435 or U+1F412. It is not whitespace nor a control character. It has no numeric value. It does not make use of emoji modifiers. It has emoji presentation by default. In collation order it should be sorted after the other Three Wise Monkey emojis. It should be part of the same categories as these.

Factors for Inclusion
---------------------

### A. Compatibility:

There are no known legacy character sets containing Do-No-Evil Monkey.

### B. Expected Usage Level: 

I expect the Do-No-Evil Monkey emoji to be used slightly less than its three existing siblings, but these are among the most frequently used emojis. Not least because they are being used to express ‘I can’t’, ‘I won’t’ or ‘I don’t wanna‘ (hear, see, say/taste/smell something). 

I have included several charts supplied by Google Trends showing the frequency of searches for “[______]” in comparison to other emoji. 

Google search for the term “[______]” returns [______] results, which is more than for [______].

### C. Image distinctiveness: 

If drawn badly, a monkey raising both hands – as if being arrested – could look much like the one covering its ears (🙉). 

If the position and posture of its hands and arms is not unusual enough, it could also be confused with  🐵 *Monkey Face* U+1F435 or 🐒 *Monkey* U+1F412.

### D. Completeness:

This character is proposed to complete a frequent, though not canonic set. While ………

### E. Frequently Requested:

I have no proof of this character being frequently requested by name, but “it wasn’t me”, “I didn’t do nothing”, “my hands are tied” and translations thereof are frequently used phrases that would be subject to be augmented or substituted by the proposed emoji character.

Factors for Exclusion
---------------------

### F. Overly Specific:

One of the two existing generic monkey emojis – 🐵 and 🐒 – could be used in proximity to all of the three wise monkeys – 🙈🙉🙊 – to signify the fourth one without further explicit determination of its *verb*-No-Evil status. This would be quite ambiguous, though.

### G. Open-ended:

There could be subsequent proposals for monkey emojis to symbolize missing senses or abilities, i.e. adding *feeling/touching*, *smelling* or *moving/walking* to existing *seeing/blind*, *hearing/deaf* and *speaking/mute* (which already doubles as *tasting* or *eating*). Glyphs for the Do-No-Evil Monkey should be able to cover anything usually done with one’s hands and either *thinking* or *copulating*.

Someone could want to propose other creature or face emojis – animal, human or other – to be used with the expressions exhibited by the monkeys, but that is pure speculation and would not depend on the existence of a fourth monkey. While the concept has been adopted to other species, the monkeys are always considered the canonic reference.

### H. Already Representable:

The intended meaning could be represented by a sequence of either Monkey or Monkey Face and a negation symbol next to an existing or future activity, hand or other body part emoji, but this would not work well alongside the three existing wise monkeys. 

### I. Logos, Brands etc.

There are some logos and brands that incorporate cartoon monkeys or apes, but non is known to me that would rely on one explicitly doing nothing.

### J. Transient:
