# Unicode Proposals

My darft proposals for new characters to encode (mostly emoji) or repurpose (using VS-16) and 
canonic character sequences (mostly involving Zero-Width Joine U+200D) to register.

* [Missing emoji human body parts, mostly taboo one like genitalia, behind and female breasts](body-parts.md)
* [New ZWJ sequences for choosing the primary color of emojis](color-selection.md)
* [More ZWJ sequences for emoji professions](professions.md)
* [Additional ZWJ sequences for families, romantic relations and other social groups](relationships.md)
* [Some ZWJ sequences and some unique emojis to replace current metaphors and line art](sexual-activities.md)
