# Unicode Proposals

This repository collects (draft) Unicode proposals for new characters to encode (mostly emoji) or repurpose (using VS-16, U+FE0F) and 
canonic character sequences (mostly involving Zero-Width Joiner U+200D, `&zwj;`) to register. 
It also contains templates, related sources, references and other material.

You can contribute to an [existing issue](https://github.com/Crissov/unicode-proposals/issues) (e.g. for [animals](https://github.com/Crissov/unicode-proposals/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aanimal), [flags](https://github.com/Crissov/unicode-proposals/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aflag), [emoticons](https://github.com/Crissov/unicode-proposals/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aemoticon) or [food](https://github.com/Crissov/unicode-proposals/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afood)) or [raise a new one](https://github.com/Crissov/unicode-proposals/issues/new) to **wish for additional proposals**.
Your help is always appreciated, but &ndash; for emojis &ndash; please read about the [Unicode Proposal Process](http://unicode.org/emoji/selection.html) first.
