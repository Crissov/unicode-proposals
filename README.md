Unicode Proposals
=================

This repository collects (draft) Unicode proposals for new characters to encode (mostly emoji) or 
repurpose (using Variation Selector 16 &lsquo;VS-16&rsquo;, U+FE0F) and 
canonic character sequences (mostly involving Zero-Width Joiner &lsquo;ZWJ&rsquo;, U+200D) to register. 
It also contains templates, related sources, references and other material.

Contribution
------------

You can contribute to an [existing issue](https://github.com/Crissov/unicode-proposals/issues) (e.g. for [animals](https://github.com/Crissov/unicode-proposals/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aanimal), [flags](https://github.com/Crissov/unicode-proposals/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aflag), [emoticons](https://github.com/Crissov/unicode-proposals/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aemoticon) or [food](https://github.com/Crissov/unicode-proposals/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afood)) or [raise a new one](https://github.com/Crissov/unicode-proposals/issues/new) to **wish for additional proposals**. 
The thing most direly needed in emoji proposals are example graphics that ideally can be used freely (even commercially) and without strong attribution requirements.

Your help is always appreciated, but &ndash; for emojis &ndash; please read about the [Unicode Proposal Process](http://unicode.org/emoji/selection.html) first. (Emojione has published a [synopsis](https://www.emojione.com/blog/so-you-want-to-propose-an-emoji-to-unicode-heres-how) that&rsquo;s probably easier and quicker to read.)
